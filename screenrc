### Keybindings
## Remove some stupid / dangerous key bindings
bind k
bind ^k
bind .
bind ^\
bind \\
bind ^h
bind h

## I hate this in emacs:
bind ^g

## Make them better
bind 'Q' quit
bind 'K' kill
bind 'I' login on
bind 'O' login off
bind '}' history
bind 'o' only

### Options
startup_message off    # No startup message thank you very much
vbell off              # Visual bell overrides the lovely beeping
defutf8 on             # Try to force utf-8

## Changed C-a to C-\ since C-a is like the most used binding ever
escape ^|\
#escape ^}]

## Fix mouse wheel
termcapinfo xterm* ti@:te@
